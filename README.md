A little bit about me:

TV Shows I've watched recently | Awesome | Should you watch it
--- | --- | ---
Motherland: Fort Salem | Yes | If you like witches and alternative history
Snowpiercer | So Far | If you want to see a class struggle in a microcosm
Avenue 5 | OMG | Only if your sympathy doesn't overwhelm you
