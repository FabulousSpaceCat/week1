### Know any good recipes?

Go make nachos with this!  Or burritos!  Or whatever, shove it in your tastehole.

**Ingredients:**

- 3 lbs of ground meat of your choice (I've used both beef and turkey)
- 1 can of refried beans
- 1 can of red enchilada sauce
- taco seasoning (I usually use enough for two lbs of meat since there is other seasoning)
- *1 large onion, diced (optional)*
- *1 can rotel (optional)*

**Instructions:**

1. Brown the ground beef, add the onions in there if you're using any.
2. Add the taco seasoning.  You should have been following the instructions on the packets.  Maybe don't drain it, it's not gonna kill you.  Just cook it longer, you're not going to overcook ground meat.
3. Add the enchilada sauce and refried beans, as well as the rotel if you're using it, mix well until heated through.
4. Serve over nachos, fill burritos, mix it into pasta, whatever.  Just eat it.  Good toppings are cheese and sour cream.

**Lazy Instructions:**

1. Put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker
2. Turn it on, return in 3-5 hours (depending on your chosen power level)  Maybe stir it every now and then.
3. ???
4. Profit!
